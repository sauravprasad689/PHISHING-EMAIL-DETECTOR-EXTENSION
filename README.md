Perfect 👍
Now I’ll make it:

• Clean
• Fully copyable
• Professional
• Stylish but GitHub-friendly
• No weird Unicode blocks that break formatting

This version will look premium on GitHub and still feel powerful.

# Gmail AI Phish Guard

AI-powered Gmail phishing, spam, and malicious email detection Chrome Extension.

A hybrid threat detection engine that combines heuristic analysis with lightweight ML scoring to analyze emails directly inside Gmail in real-time.

---

## Project Overview

Gmail AI Phish Guard performs:

* Real-time email extraction from Gmail
* Hybrid threat analysis engine
* Risk score generation (0–100%)
* Email classification: Safe / Suspicious / Malicious
* Full interactive threat intelligence report

This project is built using Chrome Extension Manifest V3 architecture.

---

## Detection Engine Architecture

Core logic implemented in:

background.js 

Hybrid scoring model:

Heuristic Engine (60%)
+
Lightweight ML Scoring (40%)
============================

Final Risk Score

### Heuristic Detection Identifies:

* Urgency manipulation phrases (e.g., "act now", "verify immediately")
* Credential harvesting attempts
* Suspicious external links
* Attachment bait patterns
* Banking impersonation keywords

### Lightweight ML Model

Keyword-weighted scoring system for phishing probability patterns.

### Verdict Logic

* Risk Score > 70 → Malicious
* Risk Score 41–70 → Suspicious
* Risk Score ≤ 40 → Safe
